    \section{The standard model}
    \label{ch:Introduction:sec:The standard model}
    During the second part of the 20th century, a model has been developed to describe a huge portion of phenomena stating 16 particle, that is six quarks, six leptons (both made up of three particle generations) and the four Gauge Bosons. The latter are carriers of the standard models interactions of the former particles, meaning all interactions of matter are based on the exchange of one or more of the Gauge Bosons.
