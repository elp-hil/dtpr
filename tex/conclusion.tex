\label{ch:Conclusion}

The whole muon detection system has been set up at the main- and readopted at the monitor spectrometer. Both systems are able to take data at rates that compare well to literature values. 

It was shown that the muon induced electron rate is well shielded by axially symmetric magnetic fields and that, under circumstances differing from those, this rate increases strongly.
