\chapter{Comissioning measurements and analysis}
\label{ch:Analysis}
%% ==============

  While the muon detection system was still under construction at the beginning of this thesis, first measurements were taken at the time with similar, already commissioned modules under preliminary conditions to investigate their general behavior. Step by step, the system was completed and is now up and running. In the building phase, several measurements and tests have been conducted to ensure the capabilities of the system meet the requirements for the KATRIN experiment. Initially, the acceleration voltages, gains and thresholds had to be set up.
  Using data acquired by the muon modules and the detector, as well as data from other subsystems, the muon induced background rates as well as both spatial and energy distribution can be obtained. Before actual measurements were done, the modules had to be set up and calibrated, meaning high voltage and signal cabling needed to be installed and high voltage power supplies had to be acquired.

  \section{Finding the best filter settings}
  \label{ch:Analysis:sec:Finding the best filter settings}
  %% ===========================  
 
  
  As the PMT tubes are directly, without any pre-amplifiers, connected to the DAQ, the signal lengths arriving at the latter are in the order of \SI{20}{\nano\second}. This poses a problem for filters as the sampling rates need to be high and anti-aliasing is inevitable. To find the best settings, a function generator has been set up to create events at known frequency and peak heigth. The function generator's signal form was chosen as closely to the actual shape as possible, which is the "pin diode" form (figures \ref{fig:pinDiode}, \ref{fig:signalShape}).

  \end{figure}
  
  In order to evaluate filter's figure of merit, the width of the resulting energy histogram, which should, assuming perfect pulser signals and perfect filters, be mono-energetic, was analyzed for each filter setting. For analysis, the width of the contributing ADC bins and their absolute position as well as the pulse height and the filter settings were noted.

  On average, the boxcar filter at shaping lengths of \SI{150}{\nano\second} shows the most promising results, i.e. the sharpest energy resolutions for any signal height. This concurs with the settings chosen for the active FPD veto; here slightly longer (around \SI{30}{\nano\second}) but comparable signals enter the DAQ's FLT cards showing best results at the same filter settings\cite{KevinWierman}.
  That is why, for any measurements after myo00000830, the new filter settings were used, bringing up the need for new threshold and gain adaptions \ref{ch:The muon detection system:sec:Gains, Thresholds and Acceleration Voltages}. 
  
  %% ===========================
  \section{Rates of single muon modules}
  \label{ch:Analysis:sec:Muon module's rates}
  %% ===========================  
  A simple first check into the data was possible by comparing the measured rates to literature values, where a flux of around 1 muon per \SI{}{\minute} and \SI{}{\square\centi\meter} through an area parallel to the ground is stated \cite{muonFlux}. The rates measured by a single module are in the order of \SI{250}{\hertz}. The muon modules' area amounts to
  \begin{equation}
  	\SI{315}{\centi\meter} \cdot \SI{65}{\centi\meter} = \SI{2.05}{\square\meter}.
  \end{equation}
  When considering the \SI{45}{\degree} tilt of the modules towards the horizontal, this area reduces to an effective area of 
  \begin{equation}
  	A_{\mathrm{eff}} = \sin{\left(\SI{45}{\degree}\right)} A_{\mathrm{real}} = \SI{1.45}{\square\meter}.
  \end{equation}
  Further taking into account detection efficiencies $\eta$ discussed in section \ref{ch:Analysis:sec:Module Efficiency}, we receive an estimation of effective rate of
  \begin{equation}
  	\Phi_{est} = \eta \frac{1}{\SI{}{\square\centi\meter}\SI{60}{\second}}A_{\mathrm{eff}} = \SI{225}{\cps}
  \end{equation}
  This compares well to measured rates of \SI{241\pm33}{\cps}.
  
  %% ===========================
  \section{Operation in high magnetic fields}
  \label{ch:Analysis:sec:Modules in high magnetic fields}
  %% ===========================  
  Photomultiplier tubes can not be operated high magnetic fields. As mentioned before, they use electrons cascading in electric fields to generate amplified signals. Additional magnetic fields can prevent the electrons from reaching the dynodes, stopping the cascade and thus keeping single events from being registered. 
  As there is the need to position the muon modules as close to the spectrometer tank as possible to register mostly muons that indeed went through the vessel, they are aligned closely to the LFCS system where fields of up to \SI{e-3}{\tesla} prevail. As rate decreases strongly - up to a complete breakdown of the signal\cite{nancy} - under these conditions, a solution needed to be found. As a simple, yet efficient passive counter measurement, a cylindrical layer of mu-metal was wrapped around the photomultiplier tubes. Mu-metal is a magnetically highly permeable material ($\mu_r$ on the order of \SI{10e5}{} \cite{permeability}) that guides the magnetic field lines inside itself. In doing so, the remaining flux inside a mu-metal surrounded volume, and with it the field strengths, drastically reduces.
  For a sphere with inner radius $a$ and outer radius $b$, the shielding factor $ F$ is given by
  \begin{equation}
  	F/B_0 = 9/\left(2\mu\left[1-(a/b)^3\right]\right),
  \end{equation}
  where $B_0$ is the initial magnetic field strength and $\mu$ the magnetic permeability of the material \cite{shielding}. Though the shape used is not spherical, the reduction factor with layers of the used tickness of \SI{0.8}{\mm} indicates a relative decrease in fields of three orders of magnitude. Even if, due to the deviant shape, this factor reduces slightly, the shielding should be sufficient for the prevailing fields.\\
  To test the improvement achieved by the mu metal coverage, measurements with rising aircoil currents have been performed.
  Steps in the size of tenths of the maximum current were used to record rates over half an hour at each value. For most of the LFCS coils this were \SI{100}{\ampere}, in some cases (LFCS 1,2 and 14) only \SI{70}{\ampere}.
  During the first run, due to a slow control problem, the current was not raised between two steps. Although displaying the expected behavior - rates dropped much less than before - the measurement was repeated with the correct currents at every steppoint.
  Measurements show that the rate still drops at currents close to the maximum, though only to around \SI{90}{\percent} of initial values, (figure \ref{fig:aircoilCountsCurrent}). As, under normal measurement conditions, the LFCS currents are mostly around half the maximum value or less, the problem was solved. In that region,  the reduction in rate is within the errors' order.

  \section{Module Stability}
  \label{ch:Analysis:sec:Module Stability}
  %% ===========================  
  If consistent factual statements on muon induced background are to be made, the modules need to work stable over the course of days, as rates are supposed to be comparable. For this reason, over the Christmas time 2012, a two-weekly measurement of half hourly runs was taken, see table \ref{tab:airCoilSettingsChristmas} for air coil settings used. Runs myo00000051 to myo00000675 contain the data of this measurement.
  \begin{table}

   \end{tabular}
  \caption[LFCS settings Stability Measurement]{Runtime settings for air coils as used for the commissioning measurements. These were kept static over the two weeks end 2012/beginning 2013.}
  \label{tab:airCoilSettingsChristmas}
  \end{table}
  The time slot was chosen because of the less frequently accessed spectrometer hall, thereby minimizing external impacts on the measurement. During data taking, the LFCS coils were active. They generated magnetic fields in which the PMT tubes had to work throughout the measurement. The LFCS settings are found in \ref{tab:airCoilSettingsChristmas}. For analysis, a simple program to count events in variable time bins was written, creating a count histogram for all the runs in the measurement period. The result can be seen in figure \ref{fig:moduleStability}. A fluctuation of \SI{5}{\percent} of the average value is observable. This variation can be ascribed to fluctuations in atmospheric density, i.e. pressure $\Delta p$ and temperature $\Delta T$ and in muon production height $\Delta h$. The change in relative intensity is decribed by
  \begin{equation}
  	\frac{\Delta I}{I} = - (\alpha_\mu\Delta p + \beta \Delta h -\gamma \Delta T),
  	\label{eq:muonStability}
  \end{equation}
  where $\alpha$ is a barometric coefficient in \SI{0.215}{\percent\per\mmHg}, $\beta$ a decay coefficient in \SI{5}{\percent}/\SI{10e3}{\meter} and $\gamma$ a temperature coefficient in \SI{0.1}{\percent\per\kelvin} \cite{muonIntensity}.
  Looking at weather data from \cite{wetterCom} available on a daily basis, the fluctuations resulting from equation \ref{eq:muonStability} do not fit the data very well. Both highest and lowest value for pressure and temperature were used to calculate daily maxima and minima in intensity. The relative change was projected onto the average rate in figure \ref{fig:moduleStability}. Although the order of magnitude does not differ vastly, even the rate development does not always compare to the ones visible in the data of the stability measurements. Several reasons may contribute to this. It has to be kept in mind that the weather data was obtained from a weather station in Rheinstetten, about \SI{20}{\kilo\meter} south of KIT campus north. Furthermore, the station only records data from the lowest atmospheric layer while muons are generated mostly in the upper layers of the atmosphere. Additionally, and this is probably the largest factor here, the muon production height was not included in the analysis as no data was available for this. As all of the fluctuations are in a window of around $\pm$ \SI{5}{\percent}, the modules' intrinsic stability does not overcome the weather induced fluctuations in muon flux. For further information on these variations, see \cite{fluxVariation}.

  \section{Module Efficiency}
  \label{ch:Analysis:sec:Module Efficiency}
  %% ===========================  
  The runs used for stability measurements, as well as any other run including three modules coaligned in front of each other, can be used to check the middle module for efficiency. For tests on other modules, the geometry would need to be changed so that the one to be checked is in between at least two other modules.
  For analysis, the function determineEfficiency() \ref{ch:Analysis software:sec:methods of the class run:subsec:determineEfficiency}
  has been written.
  The principle is the following: considering the small change in momentum direction which high energy muons achieve through interaction with matter, one can assume straight-lined paths. From that follows, that if two parallel planes, used to describe the scintillating volumes, are hit, any other, also parallel plane, in between those two will be hit as well. Keeping this in mind, one can analyze data for events registered in both modules 6 and 8 and cross check whether an event has been detected in module 7 as well. The quota of events in all three modules compared to those detected in 6 and 8 -  including the triple events - shows the efficiency of module 7.
  It shows that during the measurement period end of 2012, the efficiencies were at \SI{92.8\pm 3.8 }{\percent} which is less than one would expect at a scintillator thickness of \SI{5}{\centi\meter}.
  For that reason, the filter settings were checked and changed to the boxcar filter with a gap of \SI{150}{\ns} from the before used trapezoidal filter. However, the expected efficiency increase was not observable. The average efficiencies were now at \SI{93.4 \pm 3.4}{\percent}, well within the margin of error of the previous measurement.
  To examine the problem further, modules 3, 4 and 5, that are located next to each other, were used for efficiency measurements as well considering they are stacked in an upright way. Using the program on those three modules resulted in even lower efficiencies of \SI{50\pm 3.2}{\percent}. This raises the question whether this is not an effect of signal filtering, but a previously not considered physics effect. One thing coming to mind is deviation of the muon track from linear forms. This feature would comply with the seemingly lower efficiency at the upright stacked modules, where, at equal bending radii, the ratio of muons traveling around the middle module is higher due to the lower total area in stacking direction.
  This hypothesis should be tested via simulation of the cosmic muons including magnetic fields and empirically via variation of the distance between the single modules. The latter is difficult not only because the modules are heavy and not made for lifting (no designated carrying structures), but also because movement always means potential danger to the photomultiplier tubes and their connection to the scintillators.
  Furthermore, if all coils and solenoids were to be turned off simultaneously at some point, one could collect data then and see how efficiencies change during that (there have been runs taken when that was still the case, but only few modules were working properly at that point).
  If the dependence on module distance turns out to be true, but the efficiencies are still below expected values at the lowest possible distances, a possible improvement would be to use pre-amplifiers before signals arrive at the DAQ. These would widen the signals time-wise leading to a more easily detectable signal for the filters.
  
  %% ===========================
  \section{Photo Multiplier Tube Test with $^{90}$Sr source}
  \label{ch:Analysis:sec:PhotoMultiplierTests}
  %% ===========================
  
  With sets of four photomultiplier tubes being read out over one cable, and, consequently, via one channel, the test of individual PMTs is not trivial. Nevertheless, a method using a \SI{}{\mega\becquerel} $\rm ^{90}Sr$ source to trigger events was used to check functionality. Of course, all tubes were able to detect the source's $\beta$-electrons at any position but rates were expected to rise with decreasing distance to one of the tubes. A source holder was constructed from acrylic glass to shield the user from radiation and to attach the source to the modules, as a large dependence of rate on the position was found when the source was simply duct taped to the modules. As the foil mantling of the modules absorbs a large part of the radiation emitted from the source, it had to be ensured that the number of layers was equal for all measurements. This was given only below the modules as the foil has been folded around them at the ends in a gift wrapping way. Thus, the source was pretty far away from the photomultiplier tubes making it more difficult to distinguish between them. A first measurement was to check for exactly this distinguishability.


  \begin{figure}
  \centering
   	\includegraphics[width = 0.5 \textwidth]{graphics/cobalt/Sr90_decay.eps}
  	\caption[Cobalt Decay Scheme]{Decay scheme of $^{90}$Sr: first a lower energetic decay to $^{90}$Y emitting \SI{544}{\kilo\electronvolt}/\SI{}{\square c} electrons, from that most probably a higher energetic decay to $^{90}$Zr ground state (\SI{2.29}{\mega\electronvolt}/\SI{}{\square c} electrons) or, with low probabilty, to one of two of its excited states.}
  \end{figure}
  The first approach for a clear identification of the single PMT positions had to be dropped as all of the PMTs seemed to detect too much of the source's decays at any position (figure \ref{fig:perpendicularScan}).
  This behaviour got worse moving away from the photomultiplier tubes as the distances to the individual tubes equalized. At the same time, the closer the source was moved towards the PMT tubes, the larger the position dependence, making it difficult to compare results (figure \ref{fig:parallelScan}).
  Therefore, it was decided to measure at the four points the PMTs were located at and compare both the behavior of the rates and their overall value.
  The tube positions were used as measurement positions. For each side, a run has been taken containing five minute subruns for every position. Figures \ref{fig:SrRatesPMT12} to \ref{fig:SrRatesPMT678} show the result of these measurements. One can see that the general shapes compare well to the others. Exceptions are modules 2B and 6B that show lower rates than the others. This has been compensated for by an adaption of acceleration voltages.

  \section{Synchronization of moun detection system and FPD DAQs}
  \label{ch:Analysis:sec:Synchronisation of moun module and FPD DAQs}
  %% ===========================  
  Measuring time differences between detector signals and muon events on a \SI{}{\micro\second} scale requires exact synchronization of the two different DAQs. For this purpose, a clock has been designed sending signals at two frequencies. one at \SI{1}{\hertz} and one at \SI{e6}{\hertz} internally converted to a \SI{2 e 6}{\hertz} signal by the DAQ. Those signals can be synchronized to the timestamps of GPS satellites if a GPS antenna is connected. This has not yet been done as relative synchronization between the two crates is sufficient for the purposes of finding correlations between muon and detector events. 
  For this synchronization to work, it must be ensured that in the SLT dialogue, in the ``seconds'' section, the radio buttons ``Host time'' and ``Use for FLT cards'' are clicked. Additionally, in the FLT dialogue in section ``Init event time with'', the dropdown menu must be set to ``SLT seconds''.
  As the cable length for signal transmission is pretty extensive - around \SI{50}{\meter} - it was decided to use optical fibers instead of CAT 5 cabling. As two signals need to be transmitted, paired ST connector, multi-mode fibers for 850 nm wavelength were used. The clock itself has optical outputs, the DAQ though needs converters from optical to electrical signals and a modified SLT back panel card to receive the converted signals via Cat5 cabling. To test the setup, the muon DAQ was moved to the detector platform. Both crates were fed by a pulser signal. Runs at different frequencies were recorded to test both the synchronization and the detection of events.
  At first, manually triggered signals were used in minute runs to check the timestamps equality. Several runs were taken, all showing that the events were shifted by several \SI{}{\micro\second}.
  In close cooperation with the IPE it was found that this was merely a problem of firmware versioning as well as software settings in ORCA resolving the problem quickly. After installing the latest firmware, more runs were taken now displaying the desired behavior.

  \centering

	\caption[DAQ Synchronisation]{Time differences between events after firmware upgrades. The difference in subsecond counts, i.e multiples of \SI{50}{\nano\second} is displayed. Differences between the event times are within one bin.}
  \end{figure}
  Following the manually triggered events, runs with fixed frequency events were recorded, raising the frequency up to \SI{10}{\kilo\hertz}. In doing so, different recording modes and filter settings were applied - see table \ref{tab:syncTests}. All the tests worked fine including starting one DAQ's run way ahead of the other or mixed filter settings. Those events recorded in both run files were always synchronized.

  Afterwards, the muon DAQ was moved back to its original position and the optical fibers were stored in wire-ways guiding it from the detector platform down to the basement where the muon detection system is located. Another problem occurred here, as signal transmission was impaired by a kink at one of the turns, but was quickly resolved by smooth rewiring.
  Concluding, it can be said that the clock runs continuously without any problems throughout all the measurements - including main spectrometer commissioning measurements.

  \label{ch:Analysis:sec:Monitor Spectrometer Measurements}
  %% ===========================  
  If one wants to actually detect background induced by muonic events detected by the muon modules, those events need to be correlated to detector events time wise. For this purpose, the analysis code's class run was extended by the member functions TOFHist (section \ref{ch:Analysis software:sec:methods of the class run:subsec:TOFHist()}) and TOFMuonDet (section \ref{ch:Analysis software:sec:methods of the class run:subsec:TOFMuonDet()}), where the former is used for monitor spectrometer analysis and the latter for the main spectrometer. The biggest difference is that, for the main spectrometer, runs by two DAQs leading to different starting times and different lengths are created that need to be compared. Here, the necessity for synchronization from chapter \ref{ch:Analysis:sec:Synchronisation of moun module and FPD DAQs} becomes clear. Different magnetic field configurations were used that can be split into two generalized groups.\\
  Asymmetric magnetic fields are configurations in which the magnetic field lines do not fit into the the spectrometer vessel, but are widened to hit the spectrometer wall. This way, muon induced secondary electrons are guided to the detector on cyclotron tracks around those field lines.\\
  In non-axially symmetric configurations, the fieldlines show no rotational symmetry around the z-axis. This change in fields is achieved by an additional coil on top of the monitor spectrometer vessel. At the main spectrometer, it would only be possible using the EMCS coils \ref{ch:The KATRIN experiment:sec:Experimental setup:subsec:Solenoids, LFCS and EMCS system} but no measurements of that kind have been taken until now.

  \subsection{Monitor Spectrometer}
  \label{ch:Analysis:sec:Monitor Spectrometer Measurements:subsec:Monitor Spectrometer}
  %% =========================
  
  Measurements at the monitor spectrometer have the advantage of a fast accessibility of all the components and the collection of data in a single run-file through the mini-crate.
  For measurements, high voltage supplies have been added to the \todo{name of the rack} rack and the muon modules were connected to a newly added second FLT-card. Readout was handled by the mini-DAQ , the new FLT card was operated in veto-mode. Gains and thresholds were easily set as only four sides had to be adjusted - compared to the 16 main spectrometer channels. The PMT tubes were operated at \SI{1.5}{\kilo\volt}. The detector gain and threshold settings for the 5 pixel detector have been kept at standard monitor spectrometer operation settings. The detector position though was shifted to the position at which the center pixel exhibited maximum rate and the pairs of east-west and top-bottom pixels showed comparable count rates. Furthermore, the recording mode was switched from histogram-mode to energy-mode as the timestamps for every single event were needed for analysis. 
  Several hourly runs were taken using different magnetic field settings. Both asymmetric magnetic field (see table \ref{tab:analysis:asymmetricMagneticFields} and non-axially-symmetric field (see table \ref{tab:analysis:nonAxiallySymmetricField} configurations were investigated.

  The TOFHist function (chapter \ref{ch:Analysis software:sec:methods of the class run:subsec:TOFHist()}) has been used to analyze the data, as well as ``Beans'' code \cite{sanshiro}.
  Both tools browse through all the muon-events detected and finds any detector event in a definable timespan after (or before) the muon-event. This can be more than one detector-event per muon-event. In all of the settings, a peak is visible at around \SI{2}{\micro\second}. Count rates are a lot higher in the asymmetric magnetic field setup as secondary electrons are guided from their point of origin to the detector instead of mostly being magnetically shielded. In this setup, only the reflection through the rise in magnetic field on the electrons' paths takes its toll on the rate (see section \ref{ch:The KATRIN experiment:sec:MAC-E}).
  As data with a lot of different field configurations was analyzed, the major part of setups and analysis can be found in appendix \ref{ch:appendix:sec:A3}.
  The asymmetric magnetic field measurements show the expected behavior. With high field strengths at the wall, i.e. dense field lines, the angular acceptance is high and the peak is clearly distinguishable (see appendix \ref{fig:AA} and \ref{fig:AAf}). As the field strengths decrease, the peak height falls in correlation to the surrounding noise until it is indistinguishable (appendix \ref{fig:ABf} to \ref{fig:AD}).\\
  Non axially symmetric setups also generally showed more muon induced counts the more deformed the field was (appendix \ref{fig:NAf} to appendix \ref{fig:ND}). One exception is the setup in appendix \ref{fig:NBf} showing only few events (appendix \ref{fig:NB}). A possible explanation here is the flux tube moving off center making electrons within the flux tube miss the detector.
  All in all, the mechanism of muon inducing secondary electrons that are then being guided to the detector was confirmed. And, even more importantly, the very good shielding of the symmetrical flux tube was demonstrated. Once again, the necessity of well known symmetric fields was demonstrated.
  
  
  %% =========================
  \subsection{Main Spectrometer}
  \label{ch:Analysis:sec:Monitor Spectrometer Measurements:subsec:Main Spectrometer}
  %% =========================
  
  The monitor-spectrometer results suggested that the time of flight was well measurable, even if on bigger scale, at the main spectrometer. So, during commissioning measurements, already parallel to first measurements ``M1'', some runs with asymmetric magnetic field have been taken with switched polarity or turned off pre spectrometer magnets compared to standard setup.
  The data was analysed for each single ring of the FPD. Search parameters were the time slot from \SI{0}{\second} to \SI{10}{\micro\second}. Data remained inconclusive at the time. 
  The failure to find a clear runtime for electrons induced by muonic events might have been due to the combination of muon module position and the magnetic field setup. In the first measurements, the wall area covered by the flux tubes and the volume surveilled by the muon modules did not overlap very much. Furthermore, due to the very low magnetic field at the wall compared to the volume inside the detector and pinch magnet, most of the induced electrons are magnetically reflected as the maximum polar angle towards magnetic field lines $\theta_{max}$ is defined by
  \begin{equation}
  	\frac{B_{min}}{B_{max}} \approx \frac{3\times 10^{-4}~\text{T}}{\SI{4}{\tesla}} = sin^2(\theta_{max})
  \end{equation}
  meaning only angles below
  \begin{equation}
  	\theta < \arcsin{\sqrt{\frac{B_{min}}{B_{max}}}} = \arcsin{\sqrt{\frac{3\times 10^{-4}~\text{T}}{\SI{4}{\tesla}}}} = \SI{0.004}{\degree}
  \end{equation}
	will be able to reach the detector. All others will be reflected and fly back to the wall to be absorbed in the conducting wall material.
	As a result, compared to the monitor spectrometer, where the ratio is more favorable, a smaller number of muon induced electrons arrive at the detector making long measurements a requirement for good statistics. This leads to detector rates of only around \SI{2}{\cps}, depending on the inner electrode voltages.
	At high inner electrode voltages, the rate increases strongly to \SI{150}{\cps} which is probably due to field emission from the electrodes. Here, the rate of events actually analyzed can be reduced by using energy cuts and excluding pixels with either known problems - for example the two defective pixels - or such covered by the misaligned flapper valve. The energies were cut below \SI{25.6}{\kilo\electronvolt} and above \SI{30.6}{\kilo\electronvolt}, accounting for the PAE voltage of \SI{10}{\kilo\volt}.
  
  Analysis for every single pixel was not possible due to limited statistics, though it might be more conclusive as less different path lengths can contribute to a single pixel. On the other hand, after the non-central alignment of the detector has been fixed using different settings for the LFCS-system, the fields should be rotationally symmetric around the z-axis disregarding small deviations. Under this assumption, the path lengths for every pixel of one ring should be very comparable.
  
  
  In the anticipation of better results, different field configurations were used. One widened the flux tube so the coverages of the volume surveilled by the muon detectors and the flux tube got larger (see figure \ref{fig:mainSpec_B}). The second configuration also increased the field line density in the area of the muon modules. This again raised the probability to see electrons from detected muons at the FPD, but also raised the angular acceptance by increasing the magnetic field at the walls by a factor of two (see figure \ref{fig:mainSpec_9}).
  All in all, three different magnetic field configurations were used, which are shown in figures \ref{fig:mainSpec_100A}, \ref{fig:mainSpec_B}, \ref{fig:mainSpec_9} and described in tables \ref{tab:mainSpecSettings} and \ref{tab:mainSpecRuns}.
  
	
  To raise the overall acceptance of the muon induced events, these measurements were repeated with the main vessel on high voltage of \SI{-18.6}{\kilo\volt} accelerating all the electrons towards the FPD.
  This was done for measurements ``C'' (table \ref{tab:mainSpecRuns}). The setup was changed as the flux tube was returned to its initial setting (figure \ref{fig:mainSpec_100A}) but the muon modules were moved towards the steep cone now surveilling exactly the region of interest (figure \ref{fig:12steepCone}).

  None of the settings showed time peaks as clear as the monitor spectrometer. 
  Simulations of single events show that the fastest particles arrive after times comparable to the ones of the monitor spectrometer, i.e. at \SI{1.5}{\micro\second} (figure \ref{fig:mainSpecSimulation}). This already poses a problem. The anticipated rate of muons through the area of the main spectrometer covered by the flux tube is
  \begin{equation}
		r_\mu A_{MS} = 1/\SI{}{\square\centi\meter \second}\cdot \SI{66}{\square\meter} = \SI{660000}{\per\second}
  \end{equation}
  where the area covered by the flux tube is taken from \cite{M6Proposal}. This means that the average time between muon events of $\SI{1/660000}{\second} \approx \SI{1.5}{\micro\second} $ is of equal size as the time of flight for a single electron. This of course makes it difficult to distinguish between the different events. The measurements with field setting ``C'' were not as promising as previously thought despite the larger acceptance angle. The ones on high voltage showed a lot higher rates, though a lot of this effect may be attributed to field emission. There are runs in which one could identify peaks at the position of the simulation, though all of these are small compared to ambient signals. The most prominent one is displayed in figure \ref{fig:mainSpecProminentPeak}. It could be interpreted as a signal peak with a exponential tail. This remains very speculative at the moment. Further measurements with magnetic field setups reducing the overall area of the flux tube covered might shed more light on this. Sadly, as the time of the commissioning measurements was limited, these have to be taken at a later date.
