The FLT cards directly receive the signal output of the photomultiplier tubes via coaxial cabling. They then do first parts of data analysis to reduce data flow to the ORCA machine. In this case, only events with occur simultaneously on both sides of any module are passed on. This reduces the rate from \todo{look up non veto rate} to around \SI{250}{\hertz}. The FLT cards are made up of a large main card
